## 🧠 Aim

To simulate the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** Disk Scheduling algorithm using C. The program calculates the total seek time based on the given request sequence and initial head position.

---

## 💡 Description

- Accepts the number of disk requests from the user.
- Takes each disk request input.
- Gets the initial position of the disk head.
- Calculates the **total seek time** required to fulfill all requests in order.

## 🛠️ Compilation Instructions

Use any C compiler. For example, with `gcc`:

```bash
gcc fcfs_disk.c -o fcfs_disk
